# Cursor Commands

⭐ **Featured by [Cursor](https://x.com/ericzakariasson/status/1973932448200413539)**

A curated collection of Cursor slash-command prompts that give your team
reusable, version-controlled AI workflows directly inside the Cursor IDE.

## What are Cursor Commands?

Cursor Commands are reusable AI prompts saved as Markdown files in
`.cursor/commands/`. When you type `/` in Cursor's chat input, the IDE lists
every command from your project and your global library so you can insert the
prompt instantly. They act like AI-driven shortcuts that automate repetitive
tasks, reinforce team standards, and keep feedback consistent.

## Features

- **🚀 Quick access**: Type `/` to surface every command without leaving your flow
- **🔄 Reusable**: Standardize prompts for common tasks across the whole team
- **👥 Shareable**: Store commands in git so they ship with your repository
- **🎯 Focused**: Each command targets a specific workflow with clear structure
- **📝 Customizable**: Edit or extend the Markdown files to match your processes

## How commands work

Commands can live in two places:

- Project commands: Store Markdown files in `.cursor/commands` inside your repository
- Global commands: Store personal commands in `~/.cursor/commands` on your machine

Cursor automatically scans both directories when you type `/`, combines the
results, and inserts the selected command into the chat ready to run.

## How to use

1. Type `/` in Cursor's AI chat or agent input
2. Select from the available commands
3. Let the AI execute the prompt with the relevant project context

## Creating commands

- Create a `.cursor/commands` directory in your project root
- Add `.md` files with descriptive names (for example, `code-review.md`, `run-all-tests-and-fix.md`)
- Write clear Markdown instructions describing what the command should accomplish
- Open Cursor, type `/`, and choose your new command to execute it immediately

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository or copy the `.cursor/commands/` directory into your project
2. Open the project in Cursor IDE
3. Type `/` in the AI chat to browse available commands
4. Select a command and let Cursor execute the prompt with your code context

## Installation options

```bash
# Option 1: clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hamzafer/cursor-commands.git
cd cursor-commands
```

```bash
# Option 2: copy commands into an existing project
cp -r cursor-commands/.cursor /path/to/your/project/
```

Alternatively, create the directory manually:

1. Create `.cursor/commands/` in your project root
2. Copy or author the Markdown command files you need

## Writing your own commands

Use the existing files as templates or start from scratch:

```bash
touch .cursor/commands/my-custom-command.md
```

```markdown
# My Custom Command

Brief description of what this command does.

## Objective
Detailed explanation of the task and expected outcome.

## Requirements
- Specific requirements or constraints
- Coding standards to follow
- Expected formats or structures

## Output
Description of what the AI should produce.

Provide clear instructions for the AI to follow.
```

## Example prompts

```markdown
# Generate API Documentation

Create comprehensive API documentation for the current code. Include:

- Endpoint descriptions and HTTP methods
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error codes and responses
- Rate limiting information

Format as OpenAPI/Swagger specification.
```

```markdown
# Security Audit

Perform a security audit of the current code. Check for:

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Input validation problems
- Sensitive data exposure

Provide specific remediation steps for each issue found.
```

## Best practices

- **Be specific**: Describe the expected outcome and acceptance criteria
- **Provide context**: Reference project conventions, architecture, or standards
- **Set boundaries**: Clarify scope, assumptions, and tooling limits
- **Include examples**: Show expected formats or responses when helpful
- **Stay focused**: Keep each command targeted to a single, clear objective
- **Review together**: Treat command changes like code changes and review in PRs
- **Use descriptive names**: Make filenames reflect the command's purpose
