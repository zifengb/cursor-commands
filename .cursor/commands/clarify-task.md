# Clarify Task

Before doing ANY coding work on the task I describe:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Use 2-4 multiple choice questions to clarify requirements:

    - Data flow and architecture
    - APIs and integrations
    - Authentication/authorization
    - Edge cases and error handling
    - UI/UX expectations (if applicable)

2. **Restate requirements** - After I answer, restate the final requirements in your own words to confirm understanding.

3. **Confirm before proceeding** - ONLY then ask if I want to proceed to planning/implementation.

Keep asking questions until you have enough context to give an accurate & confident answer.
